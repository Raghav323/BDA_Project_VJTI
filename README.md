# Real-Time Big Data Analytics Pipeline

This project demonstrates a real-time analytics pipeline using Kafka, Spark Streaming, Hive, Pig, HBase, and Zookeeper.

## Components
- **Kafka**: Real-time data ingestion
- **Spark**: Real-time stream processing
- **HBase & Hive**: Data storage and SQL-based querying
- **Pig**: Batch ETL processing
- **Zookeeper**: Distributed coordination

## Running the Pipeline
1. Start Zookeeper and Kafka
2. Run Kafka producer
3. Start Spark Streaming application
4. Store and query processed data via Hive
5. Perform batch processing using Pig
